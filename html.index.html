<h1>James Mwale | WWD130</h1>
<img src="jay new_imresizer.jpg" alt="James Mwale" width="200">>
<p>Hello! My name is James Mwale. I am from the vibrant city of Blantyre, Malawi. I have a deep passion for working on cars, which allows me to combine both creativity and problem-solving in a hands-on way. In addition to that, I greatly enjoy cooking and experimenting with new recipes, as well as playing the guitar, which helps me relax and express myself musically.
I am currently studying web design, where I am developing skills in creating functional and visually appealing websites. Beyond web design, I have a wide range of interests and am always eager to learn more and take on new challenges.
I am excited to continue expanding my knowledge, connecting with others, and working towards my academic and personal goals.</p>
